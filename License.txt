LIMITED WARRANTY. The Author tries to keep the Software as bug-free as possible.

In no event shall the Author or its suppliers be liable for any for any consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages of any kind arising out of the delivery, performance or use of the Software (including without limitation damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information and the like), even if the Author has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The person using the Software bears all risk as to the quality and performance of the Software. Any description of bugs will be accepted, but the Author cannot guarantee that it will be able to correct them. 

TERMINATION. This license is effective until terminated. Violation or non-acceptance of any of the above license agreement immediately and unconditionally terminates your license. Upon termination you must destroy the Software and all copies thereof. You may terminate this license at any time by destroying the Software and all copies thereof.
